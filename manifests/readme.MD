# Manifest CRDs

The sources for the CRDs used here are from:

* cert-manager - https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.2/cert-manager.crds.yaml
* istio - running `istioctl manifest generate` version 1.6.5
* prometheus-operator - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.40/example/prometheus-operator-crd/
* sealed-secrets - by hand as upstream doesn't supply a schema for the CRD
